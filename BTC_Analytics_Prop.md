## **BTC Analytics Dashboard**

Crypto traders typically rely on a combination of price movements and on-chain activity to inform their investment decisions. While many cryptocurrency's transaction information is public, blockchain based analytic tools are just starting to become prominent. I intend to build a analytics dashboard for crypto investors to keep them up-to-date on underlying fundamentals and help them make better decisions.

## Data ##
I will download transaction information from the [blockchain.com API](https://www.blockchain.com/api) and price information from [CoinbasePro API](https://developers.coinbase.com/). I also would like to incorporate news feeds and other sources of information if possible.

### **Tools:**
I plan to use Python to set up the data acquisition pipeline which will include the following: Storing the JSON data in a MongoDB database, visualizing the data in Altair with python and deploying the application on Steamlit.

### **MVP Goal:**
The MVP goal is a fully deployed interactive dashboard running from a cloud server.
