## **BTC Analytics Dashboard MVP**

As avid Bitcoin investor, I am always looking for analytical tools to inform my investment decisions. In order to meet my needs, I created an analytics dashboard that takes advantage of real-time blockchain data from the [CoinbasePro API](https://developers.coinbase.com/) and the [blockchain.com API](https://www.blockchain.com/api). 

Behind the scenes, I built and LSTM model to predict the values for the next week and with automated daily data updates stored in a MongoDB database.

I plan to continue building out the design and incorporating more of the data that I have collected - especially recent news articles that I plan to perform NLP analysis.
